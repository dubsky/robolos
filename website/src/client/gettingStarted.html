        <p>
            Download and install Robolos first. Follow <a href="{{pathFor 'downloads'}}">this link</a> to do so.
        </p>

        <h2 class="ui dividing header">2. Install Demo Data</h2>

        <p>
            After you installed the system perform the following depending on the type of installation you have chosen:
            <ol>
              <li>Open url <i>http://SERVER_NAME:3000</i> in your favourite browser if you installed the Linux based server installation.</li>
              <li>If you installed Windows / OS X all-in-one installation just search for Robolos in the start menu on Windows or in 'Applications' folder in OS X finder. This will
              start both server and client which will be connected to the built-in server. You may configure the client to connect to  a remote server later on.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            You should be getting a page like this:
        </p>
        <img src="/getting-started/homepage.jpg" style="width:100%"/>
        <p>
            When there are no data in the system you will get an option to install demo data. This will create a couple of mock sensors and a sample dashboard, see below:
        </p>
        <p>
            Now you are all set and you can start configuration of hardware connections to sensors.
        </p>
