        <p>Robolos is an automation software that help you control and orchestrate smart devices.</p>


        <img class="ui medium right floated image" data-src="/shots/dashboard.png">

        <p><strong>Configurable and interactive dashboards</strong> to create user interface for your devices quickly. There are multiple types of widgets you can place on a dashboard. It can be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A sensor directly showing the value measured. Actors like relays and dimmers are available as well and you can control them directly from the dashboard.</li>
            <li>An automatic action that performs some more complex operation. For example when you want to automate an irrigation system which is composed of multiple branches
                such an automatic action may start watering one branch after another for a specified amount of time.</li>
            <li>You may create a floor plan image and place sensor and action widgets directly into the floor plan. This is great to organize the sensors when you are controlling the devices manually.</li>
            <li>You can create also widgets for internal variables of the system and allow the user to change it in the dashboard. For example if we return back to our irrigation example you may create
                a variable 'Irrigation disabled'. If such a variable is true the automatic action that performs the irrigation would not do anything.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Client applications for iOS, Android, Windows and OS X are available.</strong> You can either download them and install them manually
            or purchase those in respective app stores. Doing so will help us to fund further development of Robolos and keep the website running.
            Robolos also provides a web interface which is especially useful for configuring the system.
            Independently on which system you use dashboards look the same and all features can be managed. Also
            you need to build to the configuration of the dashboards just once for all the client applications.</p>

        <p><strong>Editor for automatic actions</strong> that are executed as reaction on sensor input and allow you to implement basic automation and regulation. These actions are built using the
            Blockly editor where the building blocks very carefully designed to support easy creation of the automatic actions. For example there is a block to execute an action after a specified
            amount of time expires. Such an action can be interrupted during the wait time and the block allows you also to specify the actions to take when the interruption happens. In our irrigation example it means to
            shut off all the water valves. As you can see on the image on the right you can also pause execution of an automatic action and define what should happen when the user requests to pause it and what to do
            when the user decides to continue. This is extremely useful, imaging that you are having an unplanned garden party and the irrigation schedule starts just in the middle of it. With this functionality you
            can just pause it and continue when you see fit.</p>
        <p><strong>Embedded calendar</strong> that allows you to overview schedule of automatic actions executed at regular intervals and to schedule some one time executed actions like
            starting additional irrigation at 5 AM in the morning when the weather is extremely dry and hot.</p>

        <p><strong>Pluggable driver architecture</strong> that allows you to build additional device drivers for Robolos. There is a guide for that matter including a demo template you can start with.
            Robolos is built using the Meteor framework which is based on node.js which makes it easy to extend it.
            Also, <strong>Robolos is open source</strong> and is available under the LGPL license.
